# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to analyze kickstarter campaigns from 2009 to 2017 to discover trends in campaign success based on different factors. These factors included campaign category, start date, how long the campaign lasted, fundraising goal, and amount raised. The main category of focus for this analysis was theater campaigns, specifically plays.

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to collect the kickstarter data and analyze the outcomes based on launch date and the outcomes based on goals. Two line charts were produced, one for outcomes based on launch and one for outcomes based on goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
A pivot table was created from the 'kickstarter' sheet. This pivot table would filter the data by years and parent category. The number of successful, failed, and cancelled projects are totalled for each month of the year. A line graph of number of projects per month was generated with a line per outcome. The month of October had no cancelled projects in the theater category.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
A new sheet was created that pulled data from the 'kickstarter' sheet. This sheet pulled a count of each project in the plays subcategory. There were no cancelled projects in the plays subcategories. Totals and percentages were generated from these values.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The challenge of this analysis was creating separate =COUNTIFS functions for each price category.

## Results
From Outcomes based on Launch Date, you can conclude that most theater campaigns are launched between May and July. Additionally, the success rate of theater campaigns decreases during the winter months, but success picks back up again in the spring
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
